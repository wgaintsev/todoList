# Project: todoList
This is a project to create a todoList utilizing HTML 5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS.

## Approach

I will be using an iterative approach to build out the core functionality of the todoList, breaking down the requirements into small manageable chunks and expanding upon them to add increased functionality.

## Features
The different features will include:
- Adding todos
- Changing todos
- Deleting todos
- Toggling one todo
- Toggling all todos.
